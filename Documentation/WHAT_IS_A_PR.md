# What Is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a request to merge your changes into the main project.

You open a PR after finishing updates in your branch. The PR allows maintainers to:
- Review your changes  
- Ask questions or suggest updates  
- Approve and merge your work  

You do not need to know Git or advanced tools—just open the PR and we will help if anything needs adjusting.

## What goes in a PR description?
- What you changed  
- Why you changed it  
- Any relevant context  
- Mention the maintainers:
  ```
  @Palo-Cortex/soc-framework-maintainers
  ```
