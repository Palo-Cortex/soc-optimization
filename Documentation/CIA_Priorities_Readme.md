# ðŸ›¡ Industry-Centric CIA Considerations for XSIAM Playbooks

This guide outlines how to adjust and extend XSIAM playbooks â€” starting with **"Upon Trigger"** â€” to align with **industry-specific CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)** priorities.

It is intended to be linked from foundational playbooks like `Upon_Trigger_ReadMe.md` and used by consultants, engineers, or content developers designing vertical-aligned security automation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why CIA Prioritization Matters

Different industries value **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability** differently. Automating alert handling without accounting for this leads to mismatched responses and poor risk alignment.

By tailoring the first steps in triage â€” starting with `Upon Trigger` â€” we ensure:

- High-fidelity automation
- Business-aligned prioritization
- Lower false positives and analyst noise

## ðŸ§­ CIA Profiles by Industry

| Industry              | Primary CIA Concern | Implications for Automation                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Healthcare            | Confidentiality     | Prioritize PHI tagging, legal escalation     |
| Financial Services    | Integrity           | Detect and delay unauthorized changes        |
| Manufacturing / OT    | Availability        | Escalate faster on disruption or ransomware  |
| Retail / eCommerce    | Confidentiality     | Detect fraud and protect customer data       |
| Public Sector / Legal | Integrity           | Watch for tampering, enforce audit-readiness |

## ðŸ§© Where to Customize in `Upon Trigger`

1. **Enrichment Modules**  
   Add context based on asset type, compliance scope, and user role.

2. **Decision Blocks**  
   Branch logic based on CIA priority (e.g., different handling paths for OT vs. Finance).

3. **Severity Adjustment**  
   Dynamically override severity based on CIA relevance.

4. **Remediation Gating**  
   Auto-remediate, delay, or escalate based on impact and sensitivity.

## ðŸ›  Example Snippets

### ðŸ”¹ Tag-Based CIA Routing

```yaml
IF asset.cia_profile == "confidentiality"
    â†’ Add PHI Enrichment
ELSE IF asset.cia_profile == "availability"
    â†’ Escalate Disruption Threats
ELSE IF asset.cia_profile == "integrity"
    â†’ Investigate Unauthorized Changes
```
---
### ðŸ”¹ Dynamic Severtiy Based on CIA

```python
# Python script logic for setting severity based on CIA profile
if cia_profile == "availability" and alert.type in ["malware", "DoS"]:
    incident.severity = "High"
elif cia_profile == "confidentiality" and alert.type == "unauthorized_access":
    incident.severity = "High"
```
---
### ðŸ”¹ OT Disruption Fast Track

```yaml
# Fast escalation logic for critical OT disruption alerts
IF alert.type == "ICS_disruption" AND asset.zone == "OT"
    â†’ Notify IR Team Immediately
```
